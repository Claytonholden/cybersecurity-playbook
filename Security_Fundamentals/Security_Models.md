# Security Models

Security models are frameworks that help organizations protect their data and systems. Below are three key concepts:

---

## CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity. It stands for:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is only accessible to authorized users.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data is accurate and hasnâ€™t been tampered with.
- **Availability**: Ensuring data and systems are accessible when needed.

## AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
AAA is a framework for managing access to systems and data:
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
- **Authorization**: Granting access to resources based on user roles.
- **Accounting**: Tracking user activity for auditing and accountability.
