# Risk Management

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to an organizationâ€™s assets. Below are some key frameworks:

---

## NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The NIST RMF is a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks. It consists of six steps:
1. **Categorize**: Identify and categorize systems and data.
2. **Select**: Choose appropriate security controls.
3. **Implement**: Apply the selected controls.
4. **Assess**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the controls.
5. **Authorize**: Approve the system for operation.
6. **Monitor**: Continuously monitor and update controls.

## ISO 27005
ISO 27005 is a standard for information security risk management. It provides guidelines for:
- Identifying risks.
- Analyzing risks.
- Evaluating risks.
- Treating risks (e.g., mitigation, transfer, acceptance).

## FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
FAIR is a framework for quantifying cybersecurity risks. It focuses on:
- Identifying risk factors (e.g., threat frequency, vulnerability).
- Calculating the likelihood and impact of risks.
- Prioritizing risks based on their potential impact.
