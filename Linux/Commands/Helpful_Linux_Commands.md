## Additional Tips
- **Accessing the CLI**: Use `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open a terminal in most Linux distributions.
- **Switching Terminals**: Use `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to `F6` to switch to virtual terminals (CLI-only mode).
- **Clearing the Terminal**: Use `Ctrl + L` or type `clear` to clear the terminal screen.
- **Stopping a Command**: Use `Ctrl + C` to stop a running command.
- **Viewing Command History**: Use the `history` command to see previously executed commands.
- **Auto-Completion**: Press `Tab` to auto-complete file names, directories, or commands.
- **Root Access**: Use `sudo` before a command to execute it with superuser privileges. Be cautious with root access!

## Key Linux Concepts
- **Linux Kernel**: The core of the operating system that manages hardware and processes.
- **GNU Tools**: Essential utilities (e.g., `bash`, `grep`, `tar`) that make Linux functional.
- **Distributions**: Different versions of Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS) tailored for specific needs.
- **CLI vs. GUI**: The Command Line Interface (CLI) is more powerful and efficient for system administration, while the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is user-friendly for desktop use.
- **Package Management**: Use `apt` (Debian-based) or `yum` (Red Hat-based) to install, update, and manage software.
- **Security**: Use strong passwords, enable firewalls (`ufw` or `iptables`), and keep your system updated to stay secure.
