Incident Response Plan Template

An Incident Response Plan is a structured approach for handling security incidents. It usually consists of the following phases:

1. Preparation
- Objective: Ensure the organization is ready to handle incidents.
- Activities:
  - Develop and document IR policies and procedures.
  - Train staff on incident response roles and responsibilities.
  - Establish communication channels and escalation paths.
  - Maintain an up-to-date inventory of assets and systems.

2. Identification
- Objective: Detect and confirm the occurrence of a security incident.
- Activities:
  - Monitor systems and networks for unusual activity.
  - Analyze alerts from security tools (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS).
  - Gather evidence and document findings.
  - Determine the scope and impact of the incident.

3. Containment
- Objective: Limit the damage and prevent further spread of the incident.
- Activities:
  - Short-term containment: Isolate affected systems or networks.
  - Long-term containment: Apply patches, update configurations, or remove malware.
  - Preserve evidence for forensic analysis.

4. Eradication
- Objective: Remove the root cause of the incident.
- Activities:
  - Identify and eliminate malware, vulnerabilities, or unauthorized access.
  - Clean and restore affected systems.
  - Verify that all threats have been removed.

5. Recovery
- Objective: Restore normal operations and ensure systems are secure.
- Activities:
  - Rebuild and reconfigure systems as needed.
  - Monitor systems for signs of recurring issues.
  - Conduct post-recovery testing to ensure functionality.

6. Lessons Learned
- Objective: Improve future incident response efforts.
- Activities:
  - Conduct a post-incident review with all stakeholders.
  - Document what went well and what could be improved.
  - Update the IR plan based on lessons learned.
  - Provide additional training if necessary.

Conclusion
A well-defined IR plan ensures that an organization can respond to security incidents quickly and effectively, minimizing damage and recovery time.
