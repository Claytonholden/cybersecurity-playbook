# VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)

VPNs are used to create secure, encrypted connections over the internet. Here’s what you need to know:

---

## How VPNs Work
- VPNs encrypt data between the user’s device and the VPN server.
- They create a secure "tunnel" for data to travel through, protecting it from eavesdropping.

## VPN Protocols
1. **IPSec**: Provides encryption and authentication for IP traffic.
2. **SSL/TLS**: Used for secure web browsing (e.g., HTTPS).
3. **OpenVPN**: An open-source VPN protocol that’s highly configurable.
4. **WireGuard**: A modern, lightweight VPN protocol with strong encryption.

## Use Cases
- **Remote Access**: Allow employees to securely access company resources from anywhere.
- **Site-to-Site VPNs**: Connect multiple office locations securely.
- **Bypassing Geo-Restrictions**: Access content that’s restricted by region.

## Best Practices
- Use strong encryption (e.g., AES-256).
- Regularly update VPN software to patch vulnerabilities.
- Monitor VPN logs for unusual activity.
